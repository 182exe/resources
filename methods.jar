| > Bypass Wallpaper Block with MomemtumDash
| 1. Install MomentumDash ( https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca/related )
| 2. Follow below instructions to get free premium for a little while to be able to upload custom images to wallpaper
| Notes:
| # This is literally an allowed extension in the Chrome Web Store, so no disallowed hacking going on here...

[---]

| > Get Free Premium on MomemtumDash (Abuse free trial system)
| 1. Go to momentumdash.com/team
| 2. Use tempmailo.com to get a temporary email (this will be used as the fake company host email)
| 3. Sign up using a random name, random company name, a random company website, and a company size of 301+, with the fake email from tempmailo
| 4. Once the signup completes, switch back to the temp mail tab and click on the email sent from momentumdash. Open the 'activate account' button.
| 5. Go through the setup process, *MAKE SURE TO CLICK SKIP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BILLING SCREEN*, and you do not need to invite anyone.
| 6. Login on the new-tab page by clicking the settings in the bottom-left corner. Enter the same temporary mail from earlier, and the password you set last step.
| 7. You're done! Now you can configure your settings, change your background, and more!
| Notes:
| # This will work for 1 month (?) only, then you must do it again.
| # You can use the same email if you make a company with another new email, then have the original account join that. This should preserve settings

| 2. Click on the triple dots in the top-right
| 3. Open 'more tools'

| 5. If the webapp automatically opens, then right click it's icon and click pin to save it to your taskbar. You can also access it
| 6. Open the menu by clicking the circle in the left part of the taskbar, or pressing the search key on the keyboard.
| 7. Search for the name of the website, then right click the resulting icon and click pin.
| 8. You can now open your 'app' from the taskbar which will put it in a new window instead of the browser.
| # Using this method will not have the same effect as the GeoAlgebra browser, and stuff still shows up in your search history and on WiFi logs.
| # Watch out for that.
